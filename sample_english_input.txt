My computer cost a lot of money.
Tom isn't as intelligent as you might think.
He was born to be an editor.
Reality is fake.
The plane is landing.
I can't pinpoint a location.
If you hadn't had my advice, you would've failed.
Ziri and Rima are speaking.
He is not good at putting his thoughts into words.
Tom sat between us.
I wonder if that's her.
She hasn't left the room yet.
I moved here three years ago.
He has never been interested in learning Berber.
They will be sick.
It was awfully cold that night.
Tom and Mary said they'd do that for us.
Tom and Mary watched a zombie movie.
Tom admitted that he does that.
You'll find this map very useful.
I've already told Tom not to do that.
Children hate annoying teachers.
There will be a formal dance at the casino.
I convinced Tom to lie about where he'd been.
Tom and Mary told me that they'd also do that.
I'm used to the cold.
Tom told Mary that he wouldn't cry.
I didn't notice anything unusual.
Nevertheless, I believe that these claims are insufficiently justified.
I am human.
There was a crash.
Let's sit at this table.
Sami and Layla were in the same row.
Donald Trump is a cancer on humanity.
I hope that that isn't the case.
Tom shouldn't do that by himself.
Tom began spending time with Mary.
Many people say it's like a cilantro flavor, said Walton.
I wouldn't waste any more time trying to fix that.
Tom and Mary didn't really do that by themselves.
I might as well make the most of it.
The door to the hall stood wide open.
Tom has promised that he won't do that anymore.
I can speak French, but I don't like to.
Sami is getting out of here.
Ziri often hikes in those woods.
Tom has a dog named Cookie.
He advised her to stop drinking.
Tom is a Brummie.
I'll get us some more wine.
She's a physio.
He is not your father.
Get out of bed and get dressed.
Ziri knows Rima's handwriting.
I made soup in a big pot.
They broke their own record.
Tom handed the keys to Mary.
He was so frightened that he ran for his life.
Tom loves it.
Ziri wants to show Rima something.
Neither Tom nor Mary has been supportive.
You're very clean.
They knew this would mean disaster.
I will examine your report.
We need to learn all we can about what happened.
The waiter set a coffee cup in front of Tom.
I enjoy listening to the radio.
Tom told Mary what he has to buy.
Ziri cannot change Rima.
I thought that you said Tom might do that.
Tom studied Egyptology.
This well is thirty metres deep.
Both girls wear white suits.
Teach her to live without you.
My grandfather breathed his last on that night.
It looked like you were unconscious.
I hope to go back to Boston in the spring.
He didn't buy everything he wanted.
Ziri is milking a ewe.
They say that didn't surprise them.
Be quiet, please.
It was pure incompetence on my part.
She wants to leave now.
I just spoke with your doctor.
She is a living example of that philosophy.
Sami's life is not that interesting.
I've decided to tell Tom about what happened.
What I want now is for everyone to be quiet.
I'd come to Australia if I could.
Tell me what you thought I said.
She does that when she's tired.
Tom didn't seem surprised by the question.
Tom knows that Mary can't hear.
We'll be giving you a lot of money.
You can't drink seawater because it is too salty.
The first stage of infection is asymptomatic.
My watch is five minutes slow.
I'm a wimp.
Tom told me to keep walking.
The upstairs window opened.
Mennad and Baya went to the bar.
Sing us a song, please.
Tom and Mary said they didn't have to work today.
The three of you'll stay here with us.
People love dogs.
It makes life interesting.
Don't forget to take your umbrella when you leave.
Tom starts giggling every time he sees Mary.
Mary said she couldn't help Tom do that.
This is a wonderful book.
Let's eat already.
The human race is dominant on earth.
I didn't know who to deliver the package to.
Ziri was a complete stranger.
We go to school every day except Sunday.
He said grace before eating.$Tom and I talked at length about this subject.
They're too noisy; I can't concentrate.
Tom's running to get the bus.
That's a really big one.
I hope that that's a joke.
The police interrogated Tom.
Sami doesn't have any other option.
I heard from Tom that Mary does that every Monday.
Sami skipped his biology test.
But it's true.
We both know that isn't going to happen.
Rima and Skura approached Mina.
Ziri just smiled and walked out.
Tom says he isn't ready to go.
Ziri knew every constellation.
Tom looks like he's uncertain.
Tom didn't take part in the marathon.
Stay alert.
She wears her hair up.
This girl is the flower of the school.
Tom said that he thought Mary would probably do that.
I don't see anyone.
There's no need to panic yet.
I wish you all a Happy New Year.
I've got really bad reception at the moment.
I'd like that a lot.
Tom said some teenagers attacked him.
I saved a seat for Tom.
They came to the school.
There were a lot of people waiting for the bus.
I'm not cold, thanks.
His speech met with enthusiastic applause.
Come to my house.
I hate washing dishes.
Seafood only tastes good if it's fresh.
Help me get out of the car.
Yanni is truly my given name.
Ziri had a horrific experience there.
Nobody said I wasn't supposed to do this.
They see Dan.
Tom pumped up the tire.
I don't want you even thinking about it.
Then I'd take the nickel out.
Eventually, the police car drove off.
I cannot help laughing at your folly.
I assumed that that was the reason you called me.
There wasn't enough time for us to do that today.
Time froze.
Tom proposed to Mary three months after they met.
The Inca were a religious people.
I feel bad about having made you wait so long.
Tom isn't as daring as he looks.
I love that girl.
He doesn't manifest much desire to win the game.
We'll be waiting for you when you get back.
The doctor gave Tom a thorough check-up.
I've just been sick.
It should be OK to do that now.
The senator charged that I had distorted the data.
Ziri was trimming his heathers.
Tom has already lost a lot of blood.
Only a shoe knows about a hole in a sock.
Tom is very sure that Mary can do that.
I just can't stay here and do nothing.
Tom and Mary have recently started dating.
Somebody came.
Tom said that he had something very important to say.
You can't give him that.
Tom never answers his phone during dinner.
There were many things Tom didn't like.
Tom accused Mary of stealing his wallet.
Hinduism changed me.
The windshield bullseye is right here.
Ziri was tied up in a chair.
I think that Tom is dependable.
Maybe you should ask Tom.
We can't stop him.
Tom appears to be uncomfortable.
I have seen her before.
Tom and I've always been friends.
Heat half a liter of broth.
I don't do that as much as Tom.
She's now at home with her family.
Ziri removed the grill cover of the shower drain.
It's been getting colder.
I liked that film so much I watched it twice.
Ziri wanted to hang out with Rima more.
Sami killed the dog, cooked it, and ate it.
Ziri became a certified online teacher.
Everybody loves puppets.
We'll catch them.
He went to the seaside only to be drowned.
We have had so much fun.
Tom lives across the street from me.
You can talk to her.
Male deer have antlers.
I use tarot cards almost every day.
Ziri was scared out of his soul.
Lack of sleep is bad for the body.
He's really gorgeous.
I see Tom every time he comes to Boston.
I never can tell when Tom and Mary are upset.
He muttered something unintelligible.
Mary told me she liked it.
I didn't know you could cook like this.
Tom wanted Mary to clean her room.
You'll die.
The condor never circled back a second time.
I told Tom that we could trust you.
I just don't want to go with Tom.
Tom did everything he could to find Mary.
It's been over three years since we've seen Tom.
I smoked when I was young.
We've received thirteen complaints so far this week.
You can't really be serious.
Lie on your stomach on the examination table.
Do not complete that sentence.
She's a weirdo.
